      <h1>Privacy & Terms</h1>
      <p>Privacy policies, terms, and cookies are boring (unless these cookies are made of chocolate). Still, we have to have this section, or the authorities (!) might arrest us. Just kidding, that's very dramatic. But seriously, they can shut down the website.</p>
      <p>Since we don't collect information from you (as in, you don't have to login anywhere to access our content or purchase products), we don't need to formally explain the privacy details. Just rest assured we're not obsessed with you and storing your data.</p>
      <p>You have to consent to cookies (again, not edibles) though, and a banner will appear the first time you access our website, leading to this page. So read carefully what they have to say and enjoy your time here. If you want to undo your cookie-decisions, Google how to do it because we don't know. :-)</p>
