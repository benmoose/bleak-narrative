      <h2>Your Residents</h2>
      <p>We thrive on connections, relationships, and shared experiences. Without a sense of community, especially during these difficult times, it's hard to keep our mental health in check. We need one another to create and explore different kinds of boundaries when social distancing doesn't allow closeness in the conventional sense. This space is for you to get to know something more about the people behind Bleak Narrative, as well as our partners and collaborators. We're always open to bringing more people to join us because the more, the merrier, right?</p>

            <p>I'm just a Brazilian dweeb who spent some time in Europe and fell in love with electronic music (30 years late to the party). After many blurry nights, unforgettable encounters, and friendships made on the dance floors, I decided to learn how to DJ. Unfortunately, now being trapped in my home country because of the pandemic, I'm unable to perform live and make new in-person connections. I'm a coffee addict and a terrible cook. Undateable.</p>

            <p>A Swedish goddess put on earth to ensure that people get what they want - hard techno and objective truths (the latter being a lie). I've spent most of my nightlife exploring the debauchery of Berlin, which has genuinely refined my ability to differentiate good speed from shitty speed. All "jokes" aside, I'm an explosive rave DJ and an incredible cook. So reach out if you want a taste!</p>

            <p>London raver & DJ, usually found in the darkroom. Heavily inspired by London's blistering illegal rave communities, but with a cute day-drinking disco side too. Give the big middle finger to convention, crank up the volume and get those noise complaints rolling in x (Addendum: blazing cook, I'll turn you vegan).</p>

            <p>After studying in New Orleans, New York, and Berlin, dance floors and music are pretty ubiquitous in my life. I have always found an intense solidarity and freedom around other dancers and developed some passionate ideas about current trends in electronic music. With no one to share them with near the dance floor, I've turned to writing them down on this wonderful platform filled with wonderful people. In a past life found sharing a curb and a cigarette with a stranger; currently laying low finishing undergrad in a Brooklyn apartment and practicing DJing so I may one day utter the coveted words "I only spin vinyl.‚Äù Most likely not wearing clothes.</p>
